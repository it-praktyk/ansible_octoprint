Role Name
=========

semuadmin.octoprint

Ansible role to deploy Octoprint and/or mjpg_streamer as systemd services on Raspberry Pi
running stock Raspberry Pi OS 32-bit Lite or Full (Lite is recommended). Should also work
on other Debian distributions though webcam support may depend on the specific hardware.

By default:
- Octoprint service will be available on: http://host_ip:5000.
- mjpg_streamer service will be available on: http://host_ip:8080/?action=stream.

(mjpg_streamer can be installed independently of Octoprint if required)

The user will be prompted to go through the Setup Wizard on accessing the service for the
first time, but a pre-configured config.yaml template is included with standard configuration
items already set up. These can be amended via the Octoprint admin console.

Based on instructions here:
https://community.octoprint.org/t/setting-up-octoprint-on-a-raspberry-pi-running-raspbian/2337

Support for Python3 (>= 3.7) has been added since Octoprint 1.4, but *note that* a few 
Octoprint plugins still only work with Python2 (or require additional installation procedures).
The easiest way to install under Python3 is to add a directive in your Ansible inventory
(hosts) file to point to the Python3 executable on your target host(s). For Raspberry Pi
OS this is normally `/usr/bin/python3`.

Constructive feedback very welcome.

Requirements
------------

Raspberry Pi model 3 or 4 with SSH enabled. If installing on a fresh 'headless' Raspberry
Pi server (e.g. Raspberry Pi OS Lite), add an empty file named 'ssh' to the boot directory 
of the SD card to enable remote SSH access. You may also want to set up [SSH key-based
authentication](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/passwordless.md).

Role Variables
--------------

- `install_octoprint`: true
- `install_mjpg_streamer`: true
- `uninstall_services` : false
- `uninstall_dependencies` : false
- `octoprint_user`: pi (this is the linux user under which the service runs)
- `install_dir`: "/home/{{ octoprint_user }}"
- `reset_config`: true (set to false to retain existing config.yaml)
- `octoprint_port`: 5000

- `webcam_user`: mjpg_streamer
- `webcam_dir`: "{{ install_dir}}/mjpg-streamer/mjpg-streamer-experimental"
- `webcam_port`: 8080
- `webcam_type` : "usb" (options are 'usb', 'raspi' or 'custom')
- `webcam_width`: 640
- `webcam_height` : 480
- `webcam_fps`: 10 (frames per second)
- `custom_input` : "input_uvc.so" (input parameters to be used with 'custom' webcam type)

See https://community.octoprint.org/t/available-mjpg-streamer-configuration-options/1106
for available custom options.

Dependencies
------------

To install under Python2 (**strongly** deprecated):
- Python >=2.7.9<3

To install under Python3:
- Python >=3.7

Example Playbook
----------------

At time of writing, Ansible will use the Python2 interpreter on Raspberry Pi OS by default.
To install under Python3, add the following entry to the octoprint group in your
ansible hosts file, e.g:

```
[your_octoprint_hostname:vars]
ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
```

See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/python_3_support.html 
for more details.


To install Octoprint and mjpg_streamer with Raspberry Pi camera:

```yaml

    - name: Provision Octoprint and mjpg_streamer on Raspberry Pi OS
      hosts: your_octoprint_hostname
      remote_user: pi
      become: true
      
      vars:
        webcam_type: raspi

      roles:
      - semuadmin.octoprint
```

To update Octoprint, keeping existing configuration and access credentials:

```yaml

    - name: Update Octoprint with existing configuration
      hosts: your_octoprint_hostname
      remote_user: pi
      become: true
      
      vars:
        install_octoprint: true
        install_mjpg_streamer: false
        reset_config: false

      roles:
      - semuadmin.octoprint
```

To install just mjpg_streamer with a custom uvc camera configuration:

```yaml

    - name: Provision mjpg_streamer on Raspberry Pi OS
      hosts: your_octoprint_hostname
      remote_user: pi
      become: true
      
      vars:
        install_octoprint: false
        install_mjpg_streamer: true
        webcam_type: custom
        custom_input: "input_uvc.so -d /dev/video12 -r 1920x1080 -f 15 -q 50"

      roles:
      - semuadmin.octoprint
```

To uninstall Octoprint, mjpg_streamer and all package dependencies:

```yaml

    - name: Uninstall Octoprint on Raspberry Pi OS
      hosts: your_octoprint_hostname
      remote_user: pi
      become: true
      
      vars:
        uninstall_services: true
        uninstall_dependencies: true

      roles:
      - semuadmin.octoprint
```
